//String Array Application
// This program creates a string array of a size specified by the user, then prompts the user to fill it.  It then outputs the longest string and its data, the shortest string and its data, and the string that comes first alphabetically.

//Imports TerminalIO

			stringArray[iters] = in.readLine("Please input string #" + iters + ".");
